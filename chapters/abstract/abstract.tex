\chapter*{Abstract}

\emph{Writing an abstract}:
The abstract summarizes the most important information within less than one page. Within the first paragraph, present the motivation and context for your work, followed by the specific aims. In the next paragraph, describe your methodology / approach, and / or the specific case you are working on. The third paragraph describes the results and the contribution of your work.

\emph{Comprehensibility}:
People with different backgrounds who are novel to your area of work should be able to understand the abstract. Therefore, acronyms should only be used after their full definition has given. E.g., ``This work relates to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), \ldots''.
