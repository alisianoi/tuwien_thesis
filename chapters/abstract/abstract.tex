\chapter*{Abstract}

This work describes the process of porting a password hashing scheme called Lyra2 from C99 to Java. Adding a native Java implementation should ease integration with other Java projects and simplify its usage on other platforms, such as Android phones.

This paper follows a straightforward approach. First, a brief description of the basic Lyra2 configuration is given, followed by an overview of the C99 project. Then follows a description of the ported Java project along with a number of notable challenges.

The results section \ref{sec:results} opens with both manual and automated testing which shows that both projects generate the same outputs given the same inputs. A performance comparison section \ref{sec:performance-comparison} follows, showing several thousands of measurements.

In summary, the ported Java project could be found on GitHub \cite{github:2017:lyra2-java} and on Maven Central \cite{maven:2017:lyra2}. The comparison project is hosted on GitHub as well \cite{github:2017:lyra2-compare} and could be reproduced. Generally, the ported implementation requires more processing time and memory. The main reasons for that could be found in comparison conclusion \ref{sec:comparison-conclusion}.
