\chapter*{Abstract}

This work describes the process of porting a password hashing scheme called Lyra2 from C99 to Java 1.8. A native Java implementation should ease integration with other Java projects and simplify its usage on other platforms, such as Android phones.

This paper follows a straightforward approach. First, an introduction into authentication and communication with conventional passwords is presented. Then the need for memory-hard password hashing is described and a few notable algorithms are discussed. Description of the basic Lyra2 configuration follows, with an overview of the reference implementation. Next the lyra2-java ported project is discussed along with a number of notable porting challenges.

Section \ref{sec:results} presents the results. It opens with both manual and automated testing which shows that both projects are compatible and generate the same hash values when given the same inputs. A performance comparison follows in section \ref{sec:performance-comparison}, showing several thousands of measurements. Finally, section \ref{sec:mobile-application} demonstrates a small proof-of-concept mobile application that uses Lyra2.

In summary, the ported Java project could be found on GitHub \cite{github:2017:lyra2-java} and on Maven Central \cite{maven:2017:lyra2}. The comparison project and the source code for the mobile application are hosted on GitHub as well, projects \cite{github:2017:lyra2-compare} and \cite{github:2017:lyra2-mobile} respectively. Generally, the ported implementation requires more processing time and memory. The main reasons for that could be found in comparison conclusion \ref{sec:comparison-conclusion}. However, it integrates easily into the Android ecosystem which may justify the performance drop.
